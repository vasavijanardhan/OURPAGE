School Days:-
    Growing up in this day and age,
    With free expression all the rage,
 Our young ones learn when starting
 school That reading's fun and maths is
   cool  White writing's not the least bit
boring It really is so much like drawing.
          For every child it is essential
         To realize their full potential
     And  teachers always do their best
          To stimulate their intrest.
   When years of schooldays end at last
         With all examinations passed,
        With all children reminisce
 And say,"Our schooldays we will miss"
         And  as the final day arrives,
 " They were the best days of our lives"
